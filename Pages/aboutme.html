        Hello I am April Santos, I have been a stay at home mom for the last 4 years. I have been married
        since 2013. We have a beautiful 4 year old daughter who is the boss in our small family. My husband is a hard
        worker and I have been blessed to have him have a job that has allowed me to be able to stay home and raise our
        daughter. I am at a point that I want to feel like I am contributing to our family and to have my husband be
        able to be home more and to watch our daughter grow up.
        Before I became a stay-at-home mom, I worked for Nebo School district for 10 years. For 8 of those years I was a
        Special Ed Technion this was a position that helped the Special Ed teacher with the students in the class. This
        would include helping teach and plan some lessons for the students. It would also include feedings, diaper
        changes, and anything that would help the student and/or students. 2 of the years I was a bus Technion this
        included helping students get on and off the bus, making sure they were safe on bus, helping with wheelchairs if
        needed, and also I was there to help the bus driver with the students that had any special needs and/or
        behaviors.
        In my earlier years I worked fast food Wendy’s, Artic Circle, Sonic, and McDonald’s. During the summer months of
        working for the district I worked sorting cherries and at McDonald’s for a year. By working these jobs I learned
        that it takes a team and how to work as a team to get any job done.
        In my spare time (what spare time I have a 4 year old didn’t you know that the world revolves around her) I
        enjoy reading I am not into any certain type of genres of books if it sounds good I read it. I enjoy cooking and
        feeding those around me. I believe that is one of my love languages. If I like you, I will make sure that you’re
        feed. I like to be outdoors if I could I would live in a small cabin enjoying the sweet smell of the woods.
